# Memory Game

Memory game in which you have to find all the pairs by turning max 2 cards at a time.

## TODO
Add input to select the number of pairs you want the game to have (A.K.A "difficulty") 
Fix mobile/tablet issues. 
Maybe add a scoreboard on localhost for local gameplay (hopefully have a live version if the game will ever run on a server)
